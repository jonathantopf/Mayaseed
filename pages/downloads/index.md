title: Download mayaseed
---

mayaseed is bundled with appleseed and as they are designed to work together the best way do get mayaseed is to download the latest version of appleseed. This way you can be sure that you are getting a version of mayaseed and appleseed that have been tested together.

If you are feeling brave you can also download a development version of mayaseed from github. These versions should be fairly stable but there is no guarantee that it has been tested to work with the latest release of appleseed; proceed with caution.
