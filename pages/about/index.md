What is mayaseed?
-----------------

Mayaseed is a plugin for Maya that exports geometry, lights and materials from Maya to the fantastic [appleseed](http://appleseedhq.net/) renderer. Appleseed is an open source, physically based renderer built by Fran√ßois Beaune. Find out more about appleseed [here](http://appleseedhq.net/). Rather than being a built-in Maya renderer, mayaseed currently parses the Maya scene and outputs an appleseed scene file plus all the necessary textures and geometry for rendering in appleseed.studio or appleseed.cli.

mayaseed Licence
----------------

Like appleseed, mayaseed is released under the [MIT licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), which means it is free to use and modify however you please.

Mayaseed is mainly written by [Jonathan Topf](http://www.jonathantopf.com), a London based animation director with a particular affinity for lighting / rendering. You can see what he's up to [here](http://www.jonathantopf.com).
